Interactive map visualizing Odysseus' journey through Ancient Greece

# The Plan!
Use GeoJSON and TopoJSON to create an interactive map of Ancient Greece, detailing Odysseus' path and his various stops.

I would like to add functionality that allows users to dive into each episode/location to learn more about it.

I would also like to utilize react-spring to beautify the experience with smooth animations and such.
